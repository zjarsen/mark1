# X API Setup Guide for Full Year Analysis

## 🚫 Current Status: Using Sample Data (5 posts)
The backtest currently uses 5 sample posts because we don't have real X API access.

## 🎯 To Get Real 1-Year @0xMantle Data:

### Step 1: Get X API Access

1. **Go to [developer.x.com](https://developer.x.com)**
2. **Apply for API access** (may take 1-7 days for approval)
3. **Create a new App** in your developer dashboard
4. **Generate Bearer Token** from your app settings

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

```bash
export X_BEARER_TOKEN="your_bearer_token_here"
export COINGECKO_API_KEY="your_coingecko_key_here"  # Optional
```

### Step 3: Run Full Analysis

```bash
python mantle_trading_backtest.py
```

## 📊 What You'll Get with Real API:

- **~365+ posts** from past year (depending on @0xMantle posting frequency)
- **Real engagement metrics** (actual likes, retweets, replies)
- **Precise timestamps** for accurate price matching
- **Complete strategy backtest** with all qualifying posts

## 💰 X API Pricing (as of 2024):

- **Basic Tier:** $100/month - 10K posts/month
- **Pro Tier:** $5,000/month - 1M posts/month  
- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing

## 🔄 Alternative Approaches:

### Option 1: Use Twitter Scraping Libraries
```bash
pip install snscrape
# Note: May violate X Terms of Service
```

### Option 2: Manual Data Collection
- Export @0xMantle posts manually
- Format as JSON with required fields
- Replace sample data in script

### Option 3: Use Social Media APIs
- **Brandwatch**
- **Sprout Social**  
- **Hootsuite Insights**

## 📝 Expected Results with Full Data:

Based on typical crypto project posting patterns:

- **~300-500 posts/year** from @0xMantle
- **~5-15% qualification rate** (15-75 qualifying posts)
- **Significantly more trades** and comprehensive P&L
- **Seasonal patterns** in post impact and market response

## 🛠️ Current Script Capabilities:

✅ **Ready for real API** - Full X API v2 integration implemented  
✅ **Pagination handling** - Can fetch unlimited posts  
✅ **Rate limiting** - Respects X API limits  
✅ **Error handling** - Falls back to sample data if API fails  
✅ **Date filtering** - Exact 1-year period support
